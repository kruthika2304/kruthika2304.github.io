	<p>A thumbnail menu below displays large images in the main window. 
	   Horizontal sliding action.</p>

	     Just put class in the img and set imgs to display:block -->

	<!-- instructor wants to use HTML5 menu selector, but this is not a 
	     real menu, so I'm using a div. Also, he wraps the img in an a href. 
	     This also seems un-semantic to me. And not nec. -->

<p class="under">The autoplay function on this took me a while to figure out. It was not well explained in the tutorial. But it's pretty cool. Once you click any thumbnail, the autoplay quits, and I have not included a means to restart it. I changed a lot of the CSS in the tutorial and really simplified the HTML a lot (took out a lot of DIVs), so I don't know if this will break in browsers other than mine.</p>
